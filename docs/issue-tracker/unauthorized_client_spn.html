**Debugging an Unauthorized Client Error in Terraform Initialization**

I was working on setting up an Azure infrastructure using Terraform. The setup required authentication through a service principal. The Terraform configuration included the Azure provider setup with the necessary credentials.

When working with Terraform and Azure, encountering authentication issues can be quite frustrating. One common error is related to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) and involves an unauthorized_client error during the terraform backend initialization phase. 

**This error typically looks like:**

"Initializing the backend...
╷
│ Error: Failed to get existing workspaces: autorest/Client#Do: Preparing request failed: StatusCode=0 -- Original Error: clientCredentialsToken: received HTTP status 400 with response: {""error"":""unauthorized_client"",""error_description"":""AADSTS700016: Application with identifier 'b1716973-40b6-4ce5-afb8-598012c121d9' was not found in the directory 'tenant_name'. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. 

**Understanding the Error**

This error message indicates that the service principal (SP) used for authentication was not found in the specified Azure Active Directory tenant. The error could be due to several reasons:

The service principal ID is incorrect.
The service principal has not been granted the necessary permissions.
The authentication request was sent to the wrong tenant.


After some investigation, I realized that the issue was due to using the service principal ID instead of the client ID in my Terraform configuration.

resource "azapi_resource" "umi" {
  for_each  = var.user_assigned_managed_identities
  type      = "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities@2023-01-31"
  name      = each.value
  parent_id = "/subscriptions/${var.subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${var.resource_group_identity_name}"
  location  = var.location
  body      = jsonencode({})
  response_export_values = [
    **"properties.principalId"**
  ]
}

The solution is to replace **"properties.principalId"** with **"properties.clientid"** and also configure the output file for referencing other caller module. 

**The updated code id below:**

resource "azapi_resource" "umi" {
  for_each  = var.user_assigned_managed_identities
  type      = "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities@2023-01-31"
  name      = each.value
  parent_id = "/subscriptions/${var.subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${var.resource_group_identity_name}"
  location  = var.location
  body      = jsonencode({})
  response_export_values = [
    =="properties.clientId"==
  ]
}

output "user_assigned_identity_client_ids" {
  value = { for key, umi in azapi_resource.umi : key => jsondecode(umi.output).properties.==clientId== }
}
