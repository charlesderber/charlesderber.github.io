**Troubleshooting Azure Federated Identity Error in GitHub Actions**
<br>
**Introduction**

GitHub Actions, combined with Azure Active Directory (AAD) and service principals, provides a seamless way to deploy and manage resources in Azure. By using federated identity credentials, developers can securely authenticate GitHub workflows without storing secrets.
<br>
**Understanding Federated Identity in Azure**
Federated identity in Azure allows an external identity provider, like GitHub, to authenticate to Azure services using tokens. This is particularly useful for automating workflows in GitHub Actions, where service principals can be configured to only accept tokens from specific repositories, organizations, and environments. The key component of this setup is the configuration of the federated identity credentials in Azure AD.

Key Elements:
1. Issuer: The token's issuer, typically the identity provider's URL.
2. Subject Claim: A unique identifier for the workflow, often in the format repo:{GitHub_Organization}/{Repository_Name}:environment:{GitHub_Env}.
3. Audience: Specifies the intended audience for the token, usually set to a specific value in Azure AD.

**Error**
During a recent deployment attempt using GitHub Actions, an error was encountered when the workflow tried to authenticate using Azure CLI: 
Attempting Azure CLI login by using OIDC...
Error: AADSTS700213: No matching federated identity record found for presented assertion subject repo:GitHub_Organization/Repository_Name:environment:GitHub_Env'. Please check your federated identity credential Subject, Audience and Issuer against the presented assertion.
<br>

**Root Cause Analysis**
This error indicates that the subject claim presented by the GitHub Actions workflow did not match any federated identity record in Azure AD. As a result, the authentication request was denied.

Upon investigation, the issue was identified as a mismatch in the subject claim between the GitHub workflow and the federated identity configuration in Azure AD. The subject claim must exactly match the configuration specified in the federated identity settings, including the GitHub organization, repository name, and environment.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
1. Verify Federated Identity Configuration:
    Go to the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory.
    Find the service principal used for the GitHub workflow and open the Certificates & secrets section. Under Federated credentials, check the configuration for the correct subject claim, issuer, and audience.
<br>
2. Update GitHub Actions Workflow:
Ensure that the env, repository, and organization specified in the workflow file match those in the federated identity configuration.
~~~For example:
        jobs:
        deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            env:
            GITHUB_ENV: 'production'  # Ensure this matches Azure AD configuration
            steps:
            - name: Azure Login
                uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
                tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
                subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
                allow-no-subscriptions: true
~~~

3. Confirm Token Audience and Issuer:
Ensure that the token's audience (aud) and issuer (iss) claims are correctly configured in both Azure AD and GitHub workflow settings.

4.Re-run the Workflow:
After making the necessary adjustments, trigger the workflow again to validate the changes.

**Conclusion**
Federated identity configurations can be a powerful way to secure automated workflows, but they require precise setup. By carefully verifying the configuration settings and ensuring that GitHub Actions workflows match the federated identity settings in Azure AD, developers can avoid common authentication errors. This process not only secures the deployment pipelines but also enhances the efficiency of DevOps processes.
